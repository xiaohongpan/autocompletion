The programs reads src/main/resources/test.txt file and build compact Trie.

1. The program reads the test file, build a HashMap countMap with key=word, value=number of "word"
2. Then change the HashMap to TreeMap with short string length as high priority, same string length, use alphabetic order
3. Add the sorted words from TreeMap to compact trie.

You can replace test.txt with your test file

Then you can use rest API to do the search. The maximum auto-completion words are 10. For example
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/search?word=b'

The result is
[
    "bank",
    "bat",
    "ban"
]
